# timecard

Calculates how much time was spent on various activities throughout the day.

# Usage

```
$ timecard --help
Usage
  timecard <time1> <activity1> <time2> <activity2> <time3> <activityN> <timeN>
  timecard [options]

Times must follow the following regex:

  ([1][0-2]|[1-9]):[0-5][0-9](a|p)m

For example, 8:00 a.m. is represented as "8:00am". 12:30 p.m. is represented as
"12:30pm".

Any activities named "-" will be ignored. This activity's durations are
reported as "off time" should they exist.

Options
  -h, --help        Show this help text
  -v, --version     Print program version
```

Starting with the time the first activity started, list all times that activities changed along with the activities that occurred between those times. If you spent 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. gardening then 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. reading, the command would look like this:

```
$ timecard 8:00am gardening 10:00am reading 11:00am
gardening   2.0 hours
reading     1.0 hours

Total: 3.0 hours
```

If multiple chunks of time were spent on one activity, then include the additional chunks using the same label. Expanding on our previous example, lets add two more chunks for eating lunch and reading some more.

```
$ timecard 8:00am gardening 10:00am reading 11:00am lunch 12:30pm reading 2:00pm
gardening   2.0 hours
lunch       1.5 hours
reading     2.5 hours

Total: 6.0 hours
```

Because the label `reading` appeared twice, its two durations were accumulated. This will be done for any labels which appear more than once.

To ignore certain periods of time so that they're not reported, name them `-`. This will exclude them from the printed totals. Here's what that looks like:

```
$ timecard 8:00am gardening 10:00am reading 11:00am lunch 12:30pm reading 2:00pm - 9:00pm reading 10:00pm
gardening   2.0 hours
lunch       1.5 hours
reading     3.5 hours

Total: 7.0 hours (7.0 hours off)
```
